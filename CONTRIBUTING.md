# Contributing

At the moment, I'm not 100% sure how anybody would contribute to the project. 

But if you have an idea, I'm more than happy to accept your help. 

I do not profit (monetarily!) from Klayers, and do not plan to. Hence, cannot offer money :)

But credit will most definitely be given to whoever contributes.

## For additional layers

Contributing here refers to writing code to do something. 

If you would like a new package to be made a layer, raise a `pull request` modifying the `pipeline/config/Klayers-prodp38` file.
