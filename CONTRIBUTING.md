At the moment, I'm not 100% sure how anybody would contribute to the project. But if you have an idea, I'm more than happy to accept your help. I do not accept payments for Klayers, and do not plan to, but credit will most definitely be given to whoever contributes -- again, not sure how to implement this, but I'm sure we can work it out.
